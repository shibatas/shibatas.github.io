title: This is Our Garden

Recently I had a big *Aha* moment that changed the way I view my garden, and the concept of gardening. And it happened thanks to watching Farmer Rishi on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKAFVtaeYz4). In it, he asks you to visualize yourself in the garden. Then zoom out to a bird's eye view. From there you will see that, 

> You're just like the squirrel, kind of running around... You're not in control. You're not in charge. But you have a role.
> - Farmer Rishi

There are two concepts that I learned from his message. First is about letting go of our control, and second is about sharing of the gifts of the garden with our non-human friends.

### I am not in control

I really love the visualization that Farmer Rishi recommends. In the bird's eye view of my garden, I see the squirrels running around. Then the rabbits will come out, and the birds, as well as the humans. From up there, you can't see exactly what each creature is doing. They all look like they're just running around the garden randomly. Well, except the birds of course, since they can fly.

No matter what I try to do with the garden, ultimately the nature decides what happens. I may want a tomato to grow there, but if a tomato plant isn't in nature's plans for that location, it will do poorly there. 

The key here is, I think, that it's more important to observe than to plan. 

Planning is based on what I know. That's why things don't go according to plans - because there is a lot that I don't know. And I will never know everything.

Observing, on the other hand, is based on what is actually happening. All of the factors of nature resulted in what's happening. If I look for plants that are doing really well will... that will teach me so much about what kind of plants are appropriate for a spot.

There these Daikon radish seeds that I have planted randomly around my garden in late winter, perhaps early March or so. Some are in my new "vegetable garden" in full sun but also full of clay at this moment. Some are in the shade under mature trees. And everything in between. It's fascinating to see that some of them have grown to about a foot high, but some have struggled and are only an inch tall. 

I would struggle to explain why some have done well, and others have not. But I guess there is no need for a scientific explanation. I now know a few good spots to put Daikon radishes, and possibly other root vegetables too, like carrots. And that's what is important.


### Sharing the Gifts





Us humans always like to be in control. We like to think we're in control, but we're really not. For each thing that we "know", there is a thousand things that we don't realize, and more we can recognize that, the better our actions will be. But we like to think that we understand everything and that is getting us in a lot of trouble in different places.

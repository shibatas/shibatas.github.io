It's spring in Ohio. There are some warm sunny days that are just perfect to sit out on the back porch, soak in the sun and listen to the birds. Then the cold air will come in and the temperature comes down to near freezing in the morning. In between, there are consecutive days of rain.

Today is one of the rainy days. I woke up to see wet ground, and the light rain is still falling periodically, but it's comfortable. Birds seem to love this kind of weather. They are singing so enthusiastically, and it feels like every tree around me are full of them! 

This is my first year of serious gardening. And the lesson which I am being taught is on patience.

Planting a seed is exciting. I anticipate what this seed is going to become. I fill my mind with visions of a vigorously growing plant with lots of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for our family to enjoy.

But then the reality is that things take time. *A lot more time* than I wish, especially in my first-year garden made mostly of clay. 

And to add some stress to this waiting, birds will come and eat some of the seeds. Then the squirrels will dig up the ground hoping, I imagine, to find some seeds or nuts they buried in the ground last fall. 

Whatever seeds that remained will finally pop out of the ground. The squirrels will continue to stirr up the soil, flinging the vulnerable seedlings out of the ground. And here come the slugs, happily eating up the only two leaves on these young plants.

At first, I dilligently battled these critters that were taking away my plants, with netting and fences. I'm not even sure that my efforts have really made a difference. Now, for the most part I just let it go. 

I'm not supposed to get all of my seeds to sprout. Some plants are bound be eaten. But after all that, some will remain for me and my family to enjoy. 

The thing is, this garden is not *my* garden. It belongs to the squirrels, rabbits, birds, slugs, and the plants as much as it does to me and my family. We share it.

I've heard a story about how the European settlers observed the Native Americans harvesting wild rice. They saw that a lot of the rice were falling into the water as they were being brought onto the canoe. The Europeans saw precious rice being wasted. They even invented machines to harvest the rice efficiently without dropping a grain. 

What the settlers did not realize was that the rice was being dropped on purpose in order to ensure future harvest.

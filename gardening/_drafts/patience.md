It's spring in Ohio. There are some warm sunny days that are just perfect to sit out on the back porch, soak in the sun and listen to the birds. Then the cold air will come in and the temperature comes down to near freezing in the morning. In between, there are consecutive days of rain.

Today is one of the rainy days. I woke up to see wet ground, and the light rain is still falling periodically, but it's comfortable. Birds seem to love this kind of weather. They are singing so enthusiastically, and it feels like every tree around me are full of them! 

This is my first year of serious gardening. And the lesson which I am being taught is on *patience*: to let go of what *I* want, and simply observe what nature is doing.

Planting a seed is exciting. Naturally, I anticipate what this seed is going to become. I fill my mind with visions of a vigorously growing plant with lots of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for our family to enjoy.

But then the reality is that things take time. *A lot more time* than I wish, especially, I imagine, for an inexperienced gardener like me gardening on poor soil.

And to add some stress to this waiting, birds and squirrels will come and eat the seeds. The seedlings that do emerge will be eaten by the slugs, and squirrels will dig up the ground in search of more seeds, kill some of them too.

At first, I dilligently battled these critters that were taking away my plants, with netting and fences. I'm not even sure that my efforts have really made a difference. 

Now, I've decided, for the most part, to just let it go. I'm not supposed to get all of my seeds to sprout. Some plants are bound be eaten. But after all that, some will remain for me and my family to enjoy. 

The thing is, this garden is not *my* garden. It belongs to the squirrels, rabbits, birds, slugs, and the plants as much as it does to me and my family. We share it.

As soon as I realized this, I felt *a lot* better. 

Do the basic things to help the garden thrive, like watering, but not the things to control what happens, as in choosing *me* over the *squirrel*.

Instead of wanting things to happen my way, I try to observe what nature is doing. And to observe, I have to let things unfold without my interference. 

The lupine seeds that I scattered around the yard in the winter have recently sprouted. The carrots and Daikon radishes are thriving on the heavy clay, breaking up the soil and paving a way for other plants to grow there in the future.

I don't know exactly what I will get out of my garden this year. The soil knows which plants she needs this year. Maybe lots of beans and root vegetables, I'm guessing. 

Whatever we can receive, I'll be grateful to be able to get a share.

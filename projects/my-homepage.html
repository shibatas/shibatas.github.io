<p>When I set out to design and build my own homepage, I wanted it to be clean and easy to read. I also wanted it to be very simple and quick for me to add contents, because I need all the help I can get to stay in the habit of posting new content.</p>

<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>

<p>The code for this website is public on GitHub. Feel free to click <a href="https://github.com/shohei-shibata/shohei-shibata.github.io">here</a> and take a look around.</p>

<p>This website is built on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is a very easy-to-use static site generator. I’ve used it on previous iterations of my website. I love the simplicity of creating posts in markdown. You only need to open a text editor and start creating. When you’re trying to get into a habit of writing blog posts… it definitely helps to make it as easy as possible!</p>

<p>GitHub and Jekyll work really nicely together, which is another good reason to pick Jekyll. GitHub can automatically build Jekyll-based websites. That means if I create a new post or modify the design, I simply push the code to the repository and GitHub will take care of the rest. In a few minutes usually, my website is updated with the new content.</p>

<p>My website is hosted on GitHub, and my domain (https://shoheishibata.com) is forwarded to my GitHub page.</p>

<p>Finally, I make use of the free services by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for added security and more. They offer SSL certificates, caching to make your website load faster, and I am sure a lot more features that I am not fully taking advantages of.</p>

<h2 id="responsive-topography">Responsive Topography</h2>

<p>I’ve implemented a responsive typography that scales to the viewport size, thanks to <a href="http://ricardozea.design/">Ricardo Zea</a> who taught me his simple system for doing just that. I definitely recommend anyone to check out his article on the method <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@ricardozea/100-responsive-typography-system-using-a-modular-scale-s5rhft58g">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this isn’t a sign of my age (!) but, I often find the font sizes too small and difficult to read. By using Ricardo’s method and after a lot of fine-tuning, I think I’ve got a nice readable font size whether it’s in a smart phone, desktop monitor, portrait or landscape layout.</p>

<p>Well, it looks good to me anyway. If the fonts seem too large for you, it may be that I am simply getting that old.</p>

<h2 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h2>

<p>I’m a big fan of dark mode and I turn it on whenever that is a possibility. And these days it is becoming a standard in OS and many apps to have a dark mode option. When you’ve got your OS in dark mode, it’s really blinding when you visit a website with black text over white background! That is why I’ve added the dark mode option on my website. It also remembers your choice for future visits by storing the setting in the cookie.</p>

<p>Especially with using CSS variables, I found it really easy to set up a dark theme color scheme right at the top of my (plain vanilla) CSS file.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I don’t see myself as a good writer and I may never become one. But I don’t think that should keep me from working at it. So hopefully, I can keep it going for a long time to come.</p>

<p>This website is also a sandbox for my learning to create great looking and feeling website. I am going to continue to tweak it here and there to make it better. Please stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the surface, you may still be happy when it’s sunny and not so happy when it’s rainy; you may be happy at winning a million dollars and unhappy at losing all your possessions. Neither happiness nor unhappiness, however, go all that deep anymore. They are ripples on the surface of your Being. The background peace within you remains undisturbed regardless of the nature of the outside condition.<br><cite>- Eckhart Tolle in Stillness Speaks</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my favorite passages to read from time to time. This one paragraph alone makes me incredibly content. </p>
<p>Each time I read it, suddenly it’s clearly visible what kind of thoughts are taking up space in my head.</p>
<p>Everytime I find that a vast majority of those thoughts don’t <em>really</em> matter… Thoughts about what I should’ve said or done earlier, or how that person shouldn’t have said that or done that.  </p>
<p>The truth is, nothing is accomplished by looping through those thoughts over and over in my head. They only take up the space there, preventing me from actually doing meaningful things. </p>
<p>Once I see that, I can easily let go of them, and then what’s left is an extremely peaceful, calm, focused me.</p>
<p>The things I want to change, improve, or accomplish in my life, I will take care of when it’s time to act. As long as I have a clear head, I will make the best decision that is possible for me at that time, and therefore there is absolutely nothing to worry about now.</p>
<p>Now, I should be honest and say I am in that peaceful state for maybe 2% of my day. The work on increasing that number will continue until the day I die. That passage from the book is a huge help for me in that regard.</p>

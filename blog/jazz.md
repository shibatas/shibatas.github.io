description: Hearing about the recent passing of Chick Corea has got me not only listening
  extensively to his records, but also reflecting what his music, as well as Jazz
  in general, has meant to me.

Where there is jazz music, people are paying full attention. People are listening for every note, and the minute nuances that communicates the feelings inside of the musician. 

Jazz music is such an intimate experience. It's the opposite of reaching hundreds of people with a loudspeaker. It's more like telling a story to the one person in front of you. Sometimes softly, sometimes with enthusiasm or passion, but it's always an attempt to precisely communicate a feeling.

In my mind, it's similar to a scene of an elder telling a story to a child. The story he has told hundreds of times before, so he isn't thinking about what to say next. He may say things a bit differently than the last time, depending on how he is feeling that day, but his focus is definitely on the *delivery*. 

The child is one-hundred percent captivated, because the elder is so authentic. When someone is sharing something from the core, you don't have a choice but to fully receive it.

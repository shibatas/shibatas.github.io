A simple homepage with portfolio and blog content. Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Skills

The initial design was wireframed and prototyped on Figma.

The Jekyll theme is coded from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Liquid template language, and Markdown.

The site is deployed on GitHub pages. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/shohei-shibata/shohei-shibata.github.io).

## Key Features

### Responsive Typography

I've implemented a responsive typography that scales to the viewport size, thanks to Ricardo Zea who taught me his simple system for doing just that. I definitely recommend anyone to check out his article on the method [here](https://www.codementor.io/@ricardozea/100-responsive-typography-system-using-a-modular-scale-s5rhft58g).

### Dark Mode

Allows the user to select between "light" and "dark" color modes. Feature built using CSS variables.

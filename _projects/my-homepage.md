The biggest lesson I learned from creating this website has been about what it *doesn't* need. 

### The Tool

There is definitely no shortage of tools and frameworks out there to choose from, when building a website. For my own personal website, it's pretty fun to choose what to use because it's 100% up to me. I can use whatever I like!

Nextjs and Gatsby are two of the most popular frameworks for React, and I happened to be learning about them, so I tried to use them for this website. 

I actually finished the website 90% of the way using Nextjs... But after all, I ended up switching to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

While Nextjs or Gatsby may have more features than Jekyll, I work really efficiently and stress-free with Jekyll. This could be because I'm more familiar with it, but I also like that with Jekyll I am coding in plain HTML, only inserting a little bit of Liquid syntax here and there. Ultimately HTML is what is delivered to the user, and I am really interestd in learning to write good semantic HTML and making the website as natural as possible to navigate. That can be hard to manage when the libraries and frameworks generate the HTML for you. 

There are definitely many circumstances where React, Next or Gatsby has huge advantages. A web app full of interactive elements would be such a case, and in those instances I would reach for them without hesitation in those cases. Otherwise, I think it's better to stick to the minimal approach.

That's my thought on the subject right now, anyway. Tomorrow, a new set of circumstances, and maybe a new view on things. ðŸ˜‹

### The Design

Once again, it's about what I *don't* need. Start with nothing and add only what is absolutely necessary. 

...Okay, have a little bit of fun tweaking it to my liking, but do it with restraint.

It was so refreshing and eye-opening when I first saw [Leo Babauta's website](https://zenhabits.net/){:target="_blank"} years ago. And here I am not talking about his message (which I also love!) but about the look of his website.

There is absolutely zero distractions and the reader can focus on the main content. The details like the font, the spacing, and a small bit of colors here and there really come to life. It feels so peaceful to be looking at this website.

That's the path I tried to follow. Carefully selecting font, taking care to minimize the variety of the fonts. The font size being large enough to be easy to read. (Thanks Ricardo Zea for your lesson on [modular font sizing]()!)

I inserted some effects like link highlight animation because I felt that this helped to not only make links stand out, but make the functionality very clear. 

Maybe my font choices aren't the best in some people's eyes, and the design doesn't feel right to others. I welcome all and any feedback. :) 

### Conclusion

The design *feels right* to me and I'm pretty happy with it. And I love the simplicity of updating the website using Jekyll. The only missing piece now is CONTENT! Now it's time to work on writing some posts!

The biggest lesson I learned from creating this website has been about what it *doesn't* need. 

### The Tool

For a web developer, there is definitely no shortage of new technologies and frameworks to choose from. A web development framework, for those who are not familiar, is a software that makes building a website or an app more efficient. It allows you to produce a complex product quicker, more efficiently. 

Nextjs and Gatsby, are two of the most popular frameworks for React. I took a look at them when I built this website. This was not because I saw them as the best choice for the task at hand, but because I wanted to learn.

In short, what I realized from the trial was that in a simple, non-interactive website like this (basically a blog), I love utilizing a much more minimal setup... like Jekyll.

I feel that a tool like Jekyll gives me just enough to make the process efficient, and nothing more. I am coding in plain HTML most of the time, only inserting Liquid syntax when necessary to adapt content to that particular page. What's great about this is that my brain stays *closer to the final product.*

React can be a great tool, but it's always going to be a layer of abstraction. While I am building the site in React, I am immersed in Javascript and React code. I never have to see the jumble of code that comes out the other end.

There are definitely many circumstances where the benefits of React, Next or Gatsby clearly outweight the disadvantages. I would reach for them without hesitation in those cases. Otherwise, I think it's better to stick to the minimal approach.

I always strive for a clean, semantic HTML code in the final product. I still have a lot to learn, but I always prioritize giving my best shot toward this goal. There is no better way to do that than to code in plain HTML. 

### The Design

Once again, it's about what I *don't* need. Start with nothing and add only what is absolutely necessary. 

...Okay, have a little bit of fun tweaking it to my liking, but do it with restraint.

It was so refreshing and eye-opening when I first saw [Leo Babauta's website](https://zenhabits.net/){:target="_blank"} years ago. And here I am not talking about his message (which I also love!) but about the look of his website.

There is absolutely zero distractions and the reader can focus on the main content. The details like the font, the spacing, and a small bit of colors here and there really come to life.

That's the path I tried to follow. Carefully selecting font, taking care to minimize the variety of the fonts. The font size being large enough to be easy to read. (Thanks Ricardo Zea for your lesson on [modular font sizing]()!)

I inserted some effects like link highlight animation because I felt that this helped to not only make links stand out, but make the functionality very clear. 

And I think there is no right or wrong answer here. Maybe my font choices aren't the best in some people's eyes, and the design doesn't feel right to some. And that's totally fine and normal. I welcome all and any feedback. :) 

### Conclusion

The design *feels right* to me and I'm pretty happy with it. And I love the simplicity of updating the website using Jekyll. The only missing piece now is CONTENT! Let's get to work on writing some posts!

💎Hello from Dayton, Ohio!💎

A self-taught web developer, a musician, a mechanical engineer, and a father of two boys who currently battles the rabbits and squirrels daily in the backyard as I learn how to grow a vegetable garden. 🌱 🐿

Here on this blog I share the things I learned about web development, lessons from life outside of coding, random thoughts, and anything else that I want to share with the internet.

If you find a thing or two here that was helpful or entertaining, then my mission for this website is accomplished. 

Thanks for visiting!

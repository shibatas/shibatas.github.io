💎*Hello from Dayton, Ohio!*💎

A self-taught web developer, a musician, a mechanical engineer, and a father of two boys who currently battles the rabbits and squirrels daily in the backyard as I march toward my goal of establishing a vegetable garden there. 🌱 🐿

*I looove building things.*

That's what I get to enjoy everyday working as a mechanical engineer. 

I am passionate about playing music because of the joy of life-long learning, and the irreplaceable experience of being in the same space with someone, playing music together. 

Coding? It's only natural that I got hooked. It lets me build anything, provides me with infinite opportunities to learn, and anything I build can be shared with the world. 

So all of these things that I do give me a tremendous amount of joy. But really the best part about building anything is *the positive impact it leaves on others*. 

*That's my goal with anything that I do.*

Here on this blog I share the things I learned about web development, lessons from life outside of coding, and much more.

If you find a thing or two here that was helpful or meaningful to you, that would make me very glad that I built this website!!!

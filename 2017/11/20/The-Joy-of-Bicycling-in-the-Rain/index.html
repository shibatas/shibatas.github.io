<p>When I am at peace with my surroundings… reasons to smile are found <em>everywhere</em> - Even in a rainy bicycle commute.</p>
<p>A chilly, wet November day in Düsseldorf. It’s been raining all afternoon. By 4pm it’s getting dark outside. By the time I leave the office at 6pm, sky is pitch black. Knowing it might rain today I kept my bicycle in the underground garage, so I get to start off on a dry bicycle. Awesome. I start riding home…</p>
<p>My rain poncho erases any negative consequences of being in the rain. Only my face is exposed to the weather. And rain on the face feels calming, refreshing. There’s also something about the smell of rain that calms me down.</p>
<p>And it’s really quiet. This time of the year, normally this main strip is filled with people who are Christmas shopping. But today, people are staying inside probably because of this weather. So there is only the peaceful sounds of rain drops and the trees that are lit up with warm Christmas lights. And those Christmas lights are making me feel really warm.</p>
<p>I arrive in the garage at home, hang the wet poncho on the bike, and head inside, completely content. Kids come running at me, wanting to tell me about all the exciting things they did today. Tonight there is absolutely nothing more I could ask for.</p>
<p><em>Unhappiness</em> is the gap between how things are and how we wish they would be. And happiness does not come it even if that gap is closed… Rather, if you let it, it will be replaced by just another thing to be unhappy about.</p>
<p><em>Happiness</em>, grows out of <em>accepting</em> things for the way they are. Once you accept, then instead of thinking about being unhappy, there is now room for discovery. You suddenly notice all the interesting and beautiful things all around you. <em>That</em> brings happiness out of any situation. Then it doesn’t matter how the weather is.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of times where I react with anger. But tonight I was reminded how good life can be by just letting it be.</p>

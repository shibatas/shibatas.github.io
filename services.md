I am available to hire as a freelance web developer. 

Currently I am focusing on building WordPress sites for individuals and small organizations, ranging from blogs to business homepages to online stores.

Whether it's a quick fix or modification to your website, or a full design and development, I would love to find out how I can help. I have the skills to create the website that you will be excited about, but more importantly I will be your reliable partner who will make the process painless for you. 

Especially if you are from the Dayton Ohio region, or run a business or an organization here, I would be delighted to be able to work with you and support the local community!

All you need to do to start the process is to send me a quick message from the contact page:

Or, feel free to look at other projects I've done.

# What Can I Do?

I can work with a website design tool (Figma) to make a design proposal.

I have a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be able to deliver robust and clean-looking websites. I can manipulate the looks of the website to exactly how you like it, and make sure that people can find your website by following the SEO best practice. 

I am experienced in working with WordPress. WordPress makes managing websites accessible to everyone, even if you don't know how to work with code... I love the fact that it allows me to deliver websites that anyone can work with.

When I deliver the final product to my clients, I also offer to deliver a documentation explaining how to maintain and update the website, helping to ensure that the website stays trouble-free for as long as possible!

In addition, I also know how to make interactive websites and application using React, work with backend in PHP, Ruby or Node.js.

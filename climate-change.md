Recently, Greta Thunberg has been on the news frequently with her no nonsense slap-in-the-face wakeup calls for the policy makers. And I love how she does it.

Climate change is an issue of massive scale, and I don't fault anyone for feeling like we need the politicians and the world's best technologies to solve it. 

But the thing is, the problem started with individuals, and real solutions have to come from each of us. Any solution by the most powerful in the world can only be a mere bandaid.

My summary of the book *Getting Real* by 37signals, and how I am applying the learnings into my coding or any other work. <!--more-->

*Getting Real* is a set of philosophies for building a web app, although I find that it really applies to many other things in life. We live in an age of distraction and information overload. How can we focus on the fewer, most important things, so that we can get those things done faster and with high quality? *Getting Real* gave me guidance on how to do that, and it also allowed me to feel a lot less guilty about NOT doing things that I felt *should* be done, but not absolutely critical.

## Do Less

Do the least amount as possible, but do it well. Limit the list of features to the shortest possible, containing only the most critical and impactful. Limiting the pre-planning, documentations, meetings, team size... all the things that can slow you down, keep you from being agile. 

How does it help in web app development? It promotes focus because you can devote more time on fewer tasks. It maintains a higher level of passion and momentum by getting rid of things that get in the way of them. Some pre-planning is necessary for sure, but when I have an idea that I am passionate about, I need to hack away at it while I have momentum. Doing anything else leads to a bloated to-do list and a lot of second thoughts that kills momentum. 

## Start with the most important stuff

Ultimately, user interface is the only thing which users experience. So most of the energy and focus needs to go there. Visualize the user inferface first, code later. Users are not going to read my code. The code exists for the purpose of creating a certain user interface. I should not lose sight of this while coding.

Another helpful concept is the concept of *Epicenter Design*. Just because the navigation bar is at the top of the page, I don't need to work on that first. What is the most important content of the page? Whatever it is, work on that first.

## Conclusions

We all have a limited ability to focus and do quality work. If we waste our energy on less important things, we have less energy left to do good quality work on the more important tasks.

Finally, I love the reminder at the end of the book about execution. You can easily flip through this book and say "duh, I know all that stuff already!" But the difference is whether or not you can execute. By reading this book, I have a significantly raised motivation to follow my passion, forget about everything but the most important things, and just dive in. Let's see where this will take me...

I feel like I have been preparing for this moment for years. Up to this point in my life, I did not have the right circumstances to be able to garden. For most of my life I have been moving every few years, often living in apartments. Last year, finally we moved to a house where we think we will put down roots. It feels like I am finally starting the best chapter of my life. 

In order to satisfy my enthusiasm I've read many books on gardening and nature over the past couple of years. Permaculture and natural farming are two of my favorite topics. My yard will be my laboratory about learning how to grow things naturally. My brain is fully loaded with information but I am entirely lacking in experience.  

Considering today is the day after Earth Day in my first year of real gardening, it seems way too early to be summarizing my experiences. But it's simply unbelievable how much I have learned in the past couple of months. I need to put these thoughts to writing while I remember!

### Patience


### Allow Growth

I cannot create growth. But I can surely prohibit it.


### What Can I Not Do?


### You Will Fail

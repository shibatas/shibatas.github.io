My experience of living without a smartphone, and why I went back to having one in the end.

So what is a smart phone helpful for, and how is it harmful? Here's my observation on it after going through my experiment.

# How Smartphones are Harmful

# Why Smartphones are Helpful

Communication is so multi-fauceted these days. Messages may come from Whatsapp, LINE, Google Hangout, Facebook Messenger... and I have little control over what other people use. The amount of work required just to check and respond to messages from all those sources, is something I find unnecessary and I hope will change someday. Although this is true regardless of I have a smartphone or not, it is definitely faster with a smartphone. 

Without a smartphone, it's possible to check most of those messaging platforms in a web browser. 

Going without my smartphone gave me an opportunity to see the negative impact it had in my life, but also see why it is useful. That observation is going to help me be more concious about how I use it from now on.

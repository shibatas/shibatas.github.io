When I moved back to the States, I put off buying a smart phone for a couple of months.

# The Why

Why did I choose to do this? 

You see, for some time I have been questioning my relationship with technology. In this age there is technology involved in nearly everything we do, and the society seems hungry to keep adding more. But with every benefit of technology, whether it's convenience, efficiency, or ability to do things we couldn't before, we are always losing something we used to have. With faster and more efficient transportation method, we get to go far but we miss great things right in our neighborhood. When smart phones replace a large chunk of our communication, we lose opportunities to talk to each other face-to-face. There are times when the positives of a new technology outweight the negative, but there are also situations where technologies are making our lives worse. 

The industry and the capitalism will continue to push to create and sell more technologies to us because they cannot survive without doing this. But when a technology is harmful to our lives and it is only making money for the company selling it, it's up to each of us to keep it out of our lives, despite of all the advertisement and the peer pressure.

So not just with the smart phones but with any technology, I try to see both the benefits and the disadvantages. Taking that elevator to our 5th floor apartment is easier, but by walking up and down the stairs makes for a good exercise. You are less likely to be lost when using a turn-by-turn navigation, but going without it forces you to learn the streets. Driving to work is easy, but I can get great exercise by riding my bicycle for... 2 hours? OK, that one I don't do because it's not worth it.




I firmly believe that no matter how much the technologies will advance, the best moments in life will have nothing to do with technology. Instead it will be people and nature. The airplane might have helped me to meet my family or to see that stunning scenery, and the smart phone might have let me preserve those moments. But what I will remember in the last moments on Earth will be only the moments with the people and the nature, not the technologies involved.

So it is a tragedy when I am not paying my full attention to my kid singing on the stage and all the facial expressions he is making, because I am busy taking a video with my phone.

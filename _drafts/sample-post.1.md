Intro

* A more satisfying 9-5 workplace

Less task-oriented, allowing individual's creativity to shine.

If given the time and the freedom, people will find problems and come up with creative solutions. That's much more satisfying than doing only what they are told. That satisfaction will make employees hungry to do more. The company will also benefit because each employee will be accomplishing more.

Unfortunately that's not the system we find ourselves in. We are evaluated on how we handle the tasks that we are given. We are under pressure to not fail, not to make a mistake. We are working to meet the expectations so that hopefully our paychecks will rise evenly with the tide. There is hardly an opportunity to do better than expected and be rewarded for it.

Can this system be changed? 

As employees we have little control over the systematic side, but I believe there's also a lot we can do on our own, even against the grain of the current workplace tendencies.


# Creating value is the foundation

If our value as workers lie solely on completing the tasks you are given, then our value could disappear at any moment as the world around us changes. And the world is changing constantly and rapidly. 

Instead, we should be *creating* values. How can we make the process more efficient? How do we eliminate the roadblocks that are holding us back often? How can the errors be reduced or eliminated?

Most likely, the bosses will not demand those things. They will only ask that you finish the tasks on-time and without errors. So you have to initiate the value-creating activities on your own. That could be difficult depending on the work volume at that time. But I think it's work it to make that time. And my belief is that once the management sees the outcome, they *have to* value that.

What's even better is that by improving the process, handling the job tasks becomes more efficient, freeing up even more of your time to improve the work process and quality. 

What's also happening here, is that you've created value to the company by using your observation and creativity. That will never be replaced by robots or cheaper labor. You're not only more valuable to the employer but you've also gotten a much bigger satisfaction from working. It's a win for everybody. 

This is something that could be done at any kind of work. 

So you can either work to not mess up and strive to be average, or you can become much more than that, actually add value to the workplace, and bring larger satisfaction to your life.

The schools are supposed to prepare us for the real world. 

What our schools are teaching the children is the skill of following instructions. Generally in the class the children are told exactly what will be on the test, and they are given homework assignments to practice those things. If they complete those assignments, then the test should look very familiar. Follow the rules, take care of the tasks you are given, and you will be fine.

Then it comes as no surprise that when we finish school, we seek the jobs which are most comfortable for us. We look to be hired by a company which will give us tasks to complete and paychecks in return. 

We look to live in a neighborhood with a good school system so that they may also follow the same path. Hopefully they will improve upon our own accomplishments, but the same kind of path anyway.

There is a couple of major problems with this system that we find ourselves in. 

Number one, the employees are getting less and less for the work we are putting in.

(Examples of Ford's benefit in early 20th century?)

Number two, it is holding us back from true life satisfaction.

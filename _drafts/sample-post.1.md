How much does a decent computer for coding cost in 2019? I recently bought a Samsung Chromebook 3 for $170, and I have been experimenting to see if this can function as my primary web development setup. <!--MORE--> And in my experience so far, it is pretty much doing everything I need for coding. For $1,000 less than my other laptop!

I'm going to describe how I do things on Chromebook, and the pros and the cons that I am finding. Hopefully this helps you figure out if this is worth it for you to try out.

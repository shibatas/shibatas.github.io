Working on your next great web app project but need help to finish it? Then BitHelper is what you need. You can post your project and recruit people from around the world to help you.

My task involved the backend code using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, as well as the frontend using React and React Router. The project has also been my platform for learning to use Figma as the design tool. A little bit of everything in another words...

NOTE: The project is still work in progress!

# The Development Process 

The BitHelper project came together as part of a Chingu Voyager cohort, a program that bring together developers from around the world to brainstorm a web development project idea and work on them collaboratively.

What I love about it is, that it creates a great opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and learn something new. 

You can be exposed to new frameworks, new language, or simply see a different approach to a solution. All are very eye opening!

In Voyager cohort you are randomly assigned to two or three other aspiring developers. They are very much an enthusiastic and supportive bunch of people.

We get together over a video chat on Hangouts, get to know each other, and brainstorm what we all want to work on. We arrive fairly quickly to agreement on the idea of BitHelper.

Actually the project was still unnamed at this point...

Anyway, we develop a set of user stories which the BitHelper should meet.

As a learning project, one of the first discussions are about which language and frameworks to use in our project. What skills we know, what we want to learn about, and what fits the project, are the things which drive this decision.

The consensus was that we do not want to overwhelm ourselves with new things to learn. Let's build something solid using mostly things we already know. So we chose a React-based frontend and Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for backend. Or MERN stack as people call it.

In hindsight, at this point it probably would have been better to dive deeper in the user stories and develop a more solid user experience model, and plan our code.

Instead we dove straight into coding from here, which lead to a few eventual modification of database schema and code structure.  It went OK ultimately, but it's an opportunity for improvement in the future.

With the code, first we built a basic skeleton, with an Express server connecting to database as well as a create-react-app frontend.

# What's Next?
There's still a long list of things we want to accomplish. In the code we want to learn to implement Redux to better organize state access. There are additional functionalities we want to add. 

We have so far been busy on the coding side, but the design and user experience needs a comprehensive review.

Finally, this is an opportunity to learn everything associated with implementing a web app to the real world. Data security and privacy, how to scale up, and the process of continuously making improvements...

None of this is a must. We're working on it voluntarily on top of our main responsibilities of life. But it's a great opportunity for learning and I hope to keep it going strong!

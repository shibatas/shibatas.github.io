It's spring in Ohio. There are some warm sunny days that are just perfect to sit out on the back porch, soak in the sun and listen to the birds. Then the cold air will come in and the temperature comes down to near freezing in the morning. In between, there are consecutive days of rain.

Today is one of the rainy days, but a very pleasant one with no wind and mild temperatures. Birds seem to love this kind of weather. They are singing so enthusiastically, and it feels like every tree around me are full of them! 

And this is my first year of gardening. As I watch the seeds sprout and seedlings grow, I am learning how difficult it is to be patient.

When I plant a seed, I am excited thinking about the plant that this seed is going to become and possibly the harvest that we're going to be able to enjoy. 

As I walk by that spot each day, I want to find a little seedling popping out. Once it has sprouted, I want to see the plant getting larger every day. 

But nature has its own pace which I can't change. And that pace is *a lot* slower than that of my anticipation.

I guess that's the gift. I receive an opportunity every morning as I walk through my garden, to notice this. To feel that anticipation in myself and laugh at the silliness of it. 

And sometimes, nature is even more cruel. Many seedlings will disappear as slugs eat them up, or squirrels dig up the area. I've tried this and that to protect my little seedlings, but a few weeks in I've realized that those efforts are mostly not very effective. 

First I covered up the seedlings to keep the squirrels from digging up the soil. Then the slugs got the free rein to eat the seedlings because birds and other prey cannot get to the slugs. 

So I've changed my strategy. Just let the nature take its course. After the slugs have eaten some seedlings, and the squirrels have dug up and killed some more, there will still be some seedlings remaining. 

This may or may not be the most effective strategy in terms of maximizing harvest. But I'm going to chose to go this route, and watch what happens. 

At the very worst, even if I don't have a great harvest of vegetables or beautiful rows of flowers in my garden, I will have received a great lesson on patience.

The text editor is the place where a web developer spends most of his or her time. The choice of which text editor to use, then, is a big decision. We want efficiency and we want it to be stress-free. And there are a lot of great options out there, so why would anyone want to use VIM? <!--more--> Many may not have tried to use VIM before, but I am sure you have seen it. It's that text editor in the terminal that you can't figure out how to get out of! (hint: `:q`)

VIM lacks graphical interface. Each action is performed by typing in commands, which means that you must memorize those commands. That's the steep learning curve that many talk about with VIM. But once I started to get the hang of it, it has made me highly productive and focused on my task. Not needing to use the mouse at all is a nice benefit. Also, it's a tremendously satisfying thing to learn the language of VIM, because as you use it more, you will learn more commands which continuously improves your efficiency.

Git is a version control system and it is a necessity for working with code collaboratively, but extremely helpful when working alone, or even when working with computer files other than code. 

In this article I am going to summarize the basics of what Git is, how it works, and how to get started using it with some basic terminal commands.

### What Is It


### How Does It Work


### Basic Usage

In this article I will assume that you have Git installed in your system. If not, check out this link to learn how:

##### Creating a New Git Repository

In your terminal, go to the directory where your project resides.

```
$ cd <my-project-directory>
```

Then

```
$ git init
```

This will turn your project directory into a Git repository, which means that the contents of this folder are now tracked in the Git version control system.

##### Commiting Changes

[Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture), for those unfamiliar, is ...define...

When I came to learn about permaculture, it was like finally finding words to a concept that I believed in all my life.

I have worked in automotive engineering for over a decade now, and I tend to look at everything through the lense of an engineer. Permaculture is fascinating to me because it is essentially engineering with nature.

When we think of engineering, we often imagine machines, structures, and maybe science laboratories. But at basic level, engineering is applying scientific knowledge to make things, solve problems, or make our lives better. And Permaculture does exactly that, usually but not limited to the field of natural ecosystems, with strong emphasis in ecological circularity.

Recently I watched a [YouTube video by Farmer Rishi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKAFVtaeYz4) which resonated with me so much. He explained a concept that I had felt in me but couldn't quite put into words myself. I saw his video and immediately thought, *that's what I've been feeling all along!* 

In the video, he asks you to visualize yourself in the garden. Then zoom out to a bird's eye view. From there you will see that,

There are two concepts that I learned from his message. First is about letting go of our control, and second is about sharing of the gifts of the garden with our non-human friends.

### I am not in control

I really love the visualization that Farmer Rishi recommends. In the bird's eye view of my garden, I see the squirrels running around. Then the rabbits will come out, and the birds, as well as the humans. From up there, you can't see exactly what each creature is doing. They all look like they're just running around the garden randomly. Well, except the birds of course, since they can fly.

No matter what I try to do with the garden, ultimately the nature decides what happens. I may want a tomato plant to grow there, but if a tomato plant isn't in nature's plans for that location, it will do poorly there. 

The key here is, I think, that it's more important to observe than to plan. 

Planning is based on what I know. That's why things don't go according to plans - because there is a lot that I don't know. And I will never know everything.

Observing, on the other hand, is based on what is actually happening. All of the factors of nature resulted in what's happening. If I look for plants that are doing really well... that will teach me so much about what kind of plants are appropriate for a spot, more than I could ever learn from a book.

There these Daikon radish seeds that I have planted randomly around my garden in late winter, perhaps early March or so. Some are in my new "vegetable garden" in full sun but also full of clay at this moment. Some are in the shade under mature trees, with rich soil. And everything in between. It's fascinating to see that some of them have grown to about a foot high, but some have struggled and are only an inch tall.

I would struggle to explain why some have done well, and others have not. But I guess there is no need for a scientific explanation. I now know a few good spots to put Daikon radishes, and possibly other root vegetables too, like carrots. And that's what is important.

As Farmer Rishi also says in the video, our role as humans isn't to control what happens, but to assist nature in whatever it is trying to do. Once I observe that a particular plant does well in a certain spot, I can plant more. I have learned what nature is wanting, and I can provide it by bringing the seeds.

This isn't to say that I should have zero plans for my garden. I still have my plans and dreams for what I want. But what I will do is be flexible, and adapt my plans to what I'm observing. 

### Sharing the Gifts

When we plant a vegetable garden for example, I think we tend to view all of the vegetables that grow to be *ours*, for the humans to consume. But if we go back to that bird's eye view of the garden, we will see that we are equals with the other animals. They take some, and we take some. 

And let's not forget about the plants and the soil. The vegetables are often seeds that will produce the future generations and ensure future harvest. So some needs to return to the ground, where some seeds will eventually germinate. Those seeds which fails to germinate, along with other remains of plants will be fed to the organisms in the soil, enriching it.

In nature's way, everybody is fed including the soil. It ensures that everybody is fed in the future too.

I imagine that if I let nature successfully accomplish her goals in my garden, the harvest will be so plenty that a small share of it will be engough for everyone. Everyone including the squirrels, the rabbits, the birds, the worms and the bugs.

That's state of abundance. There would be no fighting for the limited resources, and the amount of work I have to put in will become smaller and smaller.

My share may be small in the first few years as I try to help improve the soil. I am going to keep my expectations in check in terms of the harvest, and instead measure my successes in the health of the soil and the plants. 

So that's my *plan*. And things never go according to a plan. I am 100% sure that I will make mistakes along the way. Wherever this road takes me, I am going to try to accept that. I may feel disappointment from time to time, but I am going to try to focus on wins other than the size of my harvest. The more important wins of building good soil, and helping nature thrive.
